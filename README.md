# About McDonald's :
  - McDonald's Corporation is an American-based multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940  in San Bernardino, California, United States. McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue serving over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries in more than 40,000 outlets as of 2021.  McDonald's is best known for its hamburgers, cheeseburgers and french fries, although their menus include other items like chicken, fish, fruit, and salads. McDonald's has been subject to criticism over the health effects of its products. <br>
  - Key highlight of McDonald’s is that customers can select any item to view the complete nutritional information including calories, fat, sodium and Weight Watchers points. Customers can use calorie filter to find the McDonald’s menu item that best fits your diet. 

# Problem statement :
  - Ray Kroc wanted to build a restaurant system that would be famous for providing food of consistently high quality and uniform methods of preparation. He wanted to serve burgers, buns, fries and beverages that tasted just the same in Alaska as they did in Alabama. To achieve this, he chose a unique path: persuading both franchisees and suppliers to buy into his vision, working not for McDonald’s but for themselves, together with McDonald’s. Many of McDonald’s most famous menu items – like the Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish, and Egg McMuffin – were created by franchisees.
  - Analysis the given dataset and make different predictions and draw meaningful conclusion so that it should  be benificial for both company as well as  customer. Also state what can we learn from different predictions.
