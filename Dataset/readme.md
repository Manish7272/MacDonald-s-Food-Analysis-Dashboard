# Dietary fat 
  - Dietary fat(fat in foods and drinks) is important for many body processes.
  - For example, it helps move some vitamins around the body and helps with making hormones.
  - There are 4 types of dietary fat – monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, saturated and trans fat.

# Saturated fat 
  - It is one of the unhealthy fats, along with trans fat. These fats are most often solid at room temperature.
  - A diet rich in saturated fats can drive up total cholesterol.

# Trans fat
  - Trans fat is considered the worst type of fat to eat.
  - Unlike other dietary fats, trans fats — also called trans-fatty acids — raise "bad" cholesterol and also lowers "good" cholesterol.
  - A diet laden with trans fats increases the risk of heart disease, the leading killer of adults.

#  fibre
  - The main role of fibre is to keep the digestive system healthy.
